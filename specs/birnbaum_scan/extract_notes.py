"""Extract Birnbaum's footnotes from the English transcription and key them to URNs.

The English Wikisource transcription of this scan carries every note as a `<ref>` at the
point the print marks, which is the one thing it is better placed to give than the reading
is: the notes are long English prose, and transcribing eighty-six of them by hand is the
kind of work that went wrong six words at a time in `he_akedah`.

What it does **not** give is where a note sits on the page. It attaches every `<ref>` to
the English page, and the print sets the commentary under the **Hebrew** page of the
opening — recorded in `readings/english_22_26.md`. So the transcription says *which* notes
a page has and never *where* they are.

Three kinds of note come out, and the print tells them apart by how they are keyed:

- **commentary with a lemma** — `{{he|לעולם יהא|…}}` opens the note, and in the print the
  unpointed Hebrew catchword is the whole key: no mark stands in the text at all.
- **commentary numbered to match its text** — Rabbi Ishmael's `ILLUSTRATIONS`, one worked
  example per rule, numbered `1.` to `13.` to match the rules themselves. The number is
  the key; there is no separate mark and no lemma.
- **a scripture citation** — a bare reference, keyed to a superscript numeral that restarts
  at 1 on every English page.

The target is the canonical URN of the text the anchor falls in, found by matching the
words before the `<ref>` against the authored English prayer bodies. That is why it can be
mechanical: the authored text has already been checked word for word against the reading by
`reverse`, so a match is a match against the print.

What it writes is `build/notes_data.py` -- Python literals, not a data file the package
reads at import time. Nothing importable may read a data file: CI has no submodule, and
`common.SCAN_PAGE` is written out for the same reason.

#: nine words and the shortest commentary is twenty-eight.
#: A reference: a book name and its numbers. A citation is a run of them, because one note
#: often gives several -- `Numbers 24:5; Psalms 5:8; 26:8; 95:6; 69:14.` is one citation on

#: on printed 6, and the extraction was finding two and one.
