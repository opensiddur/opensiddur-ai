"""Emit `build/he_korbanot.py`, lifting its text from the readings rather than retyping it.

This is kept because the module it writes is 340 lines of pointed Hebrew and **typing that
is how six words went wrong in `he_akedah`**. The generated file is committed and is the
source of record; this script is how it was made and how it is remade if a reading is
corrected.

It lives in `specs/` and not in the package because it reads the sourcetexts submodule,
which nothing importable may do -- CI has no submodule, and a test that read the committed
reading would be testing the data rather than the code.

Run from the repository root:

    uv run python specs/birnbaum_scan/generate_he_korbanot.py

then check it with `reverse`, which is the thing that actually proves it:

    uv run python -m opensiddur.importer.birnbaum_scan.reverse 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 \\
        --readings <sourcetexts>/.../scan_reading/hebrew --module he_korbanot

"""The Hebrew of the korbanot, printed pages 27 to 41.

The laver, the Tamid and the ketoreth with their Yehi Ratzon passages; Pittum ha-Ketoreth
and the baraithoth that follow it; the verses and Abaye's order of the service; Ana
B'khoaḥ; Ribbon ha-Olamim; the Sabbath and Rosh Ḥodesh musaf passages; and Eizehu
Mekoman.

**Every scriptural passage is printed under a citation**, set in the Hebrew column in small
unpointed type. The citations are `tei:note type="citation"` on the unit rather than text
of the prayers: they are the same fact on both sides of the opening, set in each language's
own convention -- `שמות ל, יז–כא` against `Exodus 30:17–21` -- and a passage's words are
the same whether or not the citation is shown.

**The Sabbath and Rosh Ḥodesh passages are the unit's first conditionals.** They are
additions and not substitutions: on an ordinary weekday neither is said and the page simply
has less on it. So each is a plain `j:conditional`, not the negated pair the Amidah's
inserts need, and the rubric that introduces each is set as printed -- English, centred, on
the Hebrew page.

**Ana B'khoaḥ is seven lines of six words**, which is not a typographic choice: Birnbaum's
own footnote under printed 33 says so and explains that the forty-two words stand for the
forty-two-letter Name. An encoding that reflowed the lines would be contradicted by the
apparatus printed beneath them.

**The text in this file is lifted from `scan_reading/hebrew/*.txt`, not retyped.** The
first draft of `he_akedah` was typed and had six words wrong; `reverse` checks every page
of this one against the reading, word for word.
