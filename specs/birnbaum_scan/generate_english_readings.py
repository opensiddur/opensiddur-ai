"""Write `scan_reading/english/{page}.txt` from the English Wikisource transcription.

The English pages have something the Hebrew pages do not: a page-by-page transcription of
**this same scan**, at quality 4. That is not corroboration -- both are the same witness --
but it does mean the English reading is made by *correcting* a transcription rather than by
setting type from nothing, and the corrections are the part worth recording.

So this script derives the file and applies :data:`CORRECTIONS`, each of which was settled
on the image and is recorded in `readings/english_*.md`. Everything else is the
transcription's, which is the honest description: we read the English pages to find what
the transcription gets wrong, and it gets very little wrong.

What is stripped: `<ref>` (the apparatus, which is not the page's running text), and
`<noinclude>` (running heads). **Headings and citations are stripped too**, because
`hebrew/{page}.txt` excludes them and the two sides of `reverse` have to hold the same kind
of thing -- the same rule the transcription slice follows. They are read into
`readings/english_*.md` instead, and the script prints every one it drops so that nothing
goes missing quietly.

Run from the repository root:

    uv run python specs/birnbaum_scan/generate_english_readings.py

The point of the file is that `reverse` can then check the English column as it checks the
Hebrew one -- which is what would have caught `Psalm 36:8-11` standing where the print sets
an en dash.
