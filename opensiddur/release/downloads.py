"""The downloads list of a book release: opensiddur-projects/DOWNLOADS.md (opensiddur-processor#275).

Each book release attaches its books to a release of opensiddur-projects, named with the release's
tag (<book>-<variant>-vYYYYMMDD.html and .pdf), so no download URL stays the same from one release
to the next. After a release is published, release-projects.yml rewrites DOWNLOADS.md with this
module: one section per settings file, with the book's title and description and links to the
forms the release has of it.

`uv run python -m opensiddur.release.downloads RELEASE_JSON --settings-directory DIR --output FILE`

RELEASE_JSON is `gh release view <tag> --json tagName,url,publishedAt,body,assets`. The settings
directory is the one the release was built from.
