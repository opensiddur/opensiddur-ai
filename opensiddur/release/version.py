"""Version parsing and bumping.

Below 1.0.0 a release bumps the minor version by default, or the patch version for a
release that only fixes bugs, and backwards compatibility is not promised. From 1.0.0 on the project follows semantic versioning strictly, so the bump
level must be chosen deliberately rather than defaulted.

Between releases, main is the development of the next one: `0.7.0.dev0` after 0.6.0 is
released. That is what lets a settings file that needs what main has (`requires_processor:
">=0.7.0"`) be built on main before 0.7.0 is cut, and refused by 0.6.0. A release from a
development version releases the version it names, and leaves main the development of the
one after. A patch release from it fixes the last release (0.6.0 -> 0.6.1), and leaves main
the development it was.
