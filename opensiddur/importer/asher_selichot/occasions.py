"""The day on which each of Asher's services is said, as a running-order gate.

Every gate is built from what the calendar already derives -- the Hebrew date, the Hebrew
weekday, the holidays and the Ten Days -- so a dated edition prints only that day's
Selichot and an undated one prints them all, with nothing around them.

The days before Rosh Hashanah follow the book's own rule (first-day rubric): the Selichot
begin on the Sunday before the New Year, or on the Sunday a week earlier when it falls on
Monday or Tuesday. They are not said on the Sabbath, and the days are said in order, so a
short year never reaches the later ones. Rosh Hashanah falls on only four weekdays, and
each service's gate is the union of its date over all four.
