"""The open questions, and nothing else.

A page's differences are mostly settled the moment they are looked at, and the settled
ones are noise to whoever has to decide the rest. This collects only what is still open --
across every page read so far -- and writes it as a queue with enough of the surrounding
phrase to decide from, one block per question and a blank `answer:` line under each.

Two states are open, and the distinction is the whole reason this exists:

``unresolved``
    written down, looked at, not settled.
``(absent)``
    no entry in the page's verdict file at all. Indistinguishable, until now, from a page
    nobody had opened -- which is how six of page 7's differences came to be invisible.

Answer a question by writing the form the print actually carries on the `answer:` line, or
by writing `print` or `reading` if that is easier. `apply` turns those into verdicts:
the reading's own form means `print`, the transcription's means `reading`, and anything
else is refused rather than guessed at.
