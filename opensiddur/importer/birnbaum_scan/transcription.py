"""Resolve the Hebrew Wikisource foundation text to the reading *this* book prints.

The Wikisource edition is not a reproduction of the 1949 print: it renders Birnbaum's
English rubrics into Hebrew, adds Eretz Yisrael customs, and corrects the text. Where its
editors knew the print differs from what they set, they said so in a `{{נוסח}}` template
rather than silently choosing -- so the template is the most useful thing in the file, and
stripping it throws away exactly the evidence the comparison is for.

Four conventions are in use, and one of them inverts:

    {{נוסח|X|בירנבוים=Y}}                 X is the default, Y is what Birnbaum prints
    {{נוסח|X|=מסורה|בירנבוים=Y}}           X is the Masorah's, Y is what Birnbaum prints
    {{נוסח|X|=בירנבוים|אחרים=Y}}           *X* is what Birnbaum prints, Y is everyone else
    {{נוסח|X|=בירנבוים ועבו"י|אחרים=Y}}     likewise, X, shared with another edition

So a `בירנבוים=` parameter cannot simply be preferred: where the unnamed attribution
already credits the first positional to Birnbaum, that positional is the reading and
`אחרים=` is the variant to discard.

A `בירנבוים=` value is not always a reading. One in the morning blessings is a sentence
about how he sets two Torah portions, with no word to substitute. A value that does not
look like a short run of pointed Hebrew is treated as a comment: the positional stands,
and the comment is reported so the reading can record it.
