"""Birnbaum's English for Mah Tovu and the tallith order, from printed pages 4 and 6.

Same URNs as the Hebrew, which is what aligns them. The one place the two sides are
shaped differently is Mah Tovu, and that difference is the reason the parting is named:
the Hebrew page sets the whole catena as one paragraph and this page sets it as two, so
each side keeps its own paragraphing and the two halves carry the URNs that pair them.

See `he_tallith` for the argument. Here it means two ``tei:p`` where the Hebrew has two
milestone ranges inside one; both sides use the same milestone units.
