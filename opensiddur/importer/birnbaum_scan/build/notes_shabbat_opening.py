    'the blessing pronounced at the lighting of the Sabbath light, is not cited in the Talmud but is found in the ninth century <tei:hi rend="italic">Siddur</tei:hi> of Amram Gaon. The custom of lighting two lights is in keeping with the two terms “Remember” and “Observe” which introduce the Sabbath Commandment in Exodus 20:8 and Deuteronomy 5:12, respectively. The lights are symbolical of the cheerfulness and serenity which distinguish the holy days.', lemma='ברכת הנר'),
 note(PRAYER+'birkat_horim',
    'the blessing of children by their parents on all important occasions, notably on the eve of Sabbaths and festivals, is one of the most beautiful customs. The <tei:hi rend="italic">Brantspiegel</tei:hi>, a treatise on morals published in 1602, mentions this in the following terms: “Before the children can walk they should be carried on Sabbaths and festivals to the father and mother to be blessed; after they are able to walk they shall go of their own accord with bowed body and shall incline their heads and receive the blessing.” This custom has linked the generations together in mutual loyalty and affection.', lemma='ברכת הורים'),

    'is recited every Friday evening because of the religious idealism attached to it by tradition. The poem has been accepted throughout the ages as an allegory of the relations between God and his people. Some nineteen centuries ago, Rabbi Akiba declared: “All the <tei:hi rend="italic">Kethubim</tei:hi> are holy, but the Song of Songs is the holiest of all.” According to the paraphrase of the Targum, the poem portrays the history of Israel till the times of the Messiah. It has been regarded also as a representation of the affection of Israel for the Sabbath. The author of the poem <tei:foreign xml:lang="he">לכה דודי</tei:foreign>, “one of the finest pieces of religious poetry in existence,” used the theme of the Sabbath bride and borrowed the title of his famous hymn from the Song of Songs (7:12). Although its meaning has been extended by various methods of interpretation, one cannot miss the beauty of the poem in its literal interpretation. Its author takes us along with him into the open air, to the vineyards, the villages, the mountains. He awakens us at daybreak to catch the scent of the forest trees, to gather the apples and the pomegranates. His verse is fragrant with the breath of spring.', lemma='שיר השירים'),
