 note(URNS['psalm134']+'/1', 'the evening service, does not correspond to any sacrifice in the Temple since the offering of sacrifices occurred only twice a day, morning and afternoon. Hence in talmudic times and in a greater part of the geonic period the Shemoneh Esreh was omitted from the Ma‘ariv service. To replace the Eighteen Benedictions, eighteen scattered biblical verses, each mentioning the name of God, were introduced at the end of the Ma‘ariv service. This passage, beginning with <tei:foreign xml:lang="he">ברוך ה׳ לעולם</tei:foreign>, was arranged by “the heads of the Babylonian academies” (Maḥzor Vitry, page 78). It is followed by half-Kaddish probably because at one time it marked the end of the evening service, as may be seen from the Siddur of Amram Gaon (ninth century). Maimonides asserts that since the Jews everywhere consented to say the evening prayer regularly, it is equivalent to an obligation (Tefillah 1:6). The controversy in the Talmud as to whether the evening prayer is optional or obligatory refers to the Shemoneh Esreh and not to the Shema, which it is obligatory to recite morning and evening. Since the Ma‘ariv prayer was considered by some talmudic rabbis to be optional, the Shemoneh Esreh is not repeated by the Reader and the Kedushah is not recited.',lemma='תפלת ערבית'),
