"""Birnbaum's English for Seder Hanachath Tefillin, from printed pages 6, 8, 10 and 12.

Same URNs as the Hebrew, which is what aligns them. Three page turns, all mid-sentence and
all falling at the same point as the Hebrew side's -- the meditation, the Yehi Ratzon and
the parashiyoth each begin on one page and end on the next, on both sides of the opening.

Barukh Shem is transcluded, not emitted: see `he_tefillin`.

`Menorah` is marked foreign here as `tallith` and `tefillin` are. The print sets it italic
inside running roman text, which is the opposite of the rubrics' case and the same intent.

This day you are leaving, in the month of Abib. And when the Lord will bring you into the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivvite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to your fathers he would give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, then you shall perform this service in this month: For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a festival in honor of the Lord. Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen in your possession, nor any leaven, anywhere in your territory. And you shall tell your son on that day, saying; This is on account of what the Lord did for me when I left Egypt. It shall serve you as a sign on your hand, and as frontlets between your eyes, so that the Lord’s teaching may be ever in your mouth; for by a strong hand the Lord brought you out of Egypt. You shall observe this ordinance at its proper time from year to year. “And when the Lord will bring you into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and will give it to you, you shall make over to the Lord whatever is first-born; all the firstlings of the young animals that you will have, the males, shall be the Lord’s. Every firstling ass, however, you shall redeem with a lamb; but if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and every first-born son of yours you shall redeem. And when your son asks you in time to come: What does this mean? You shall tell him: By a strong hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt, out of a house of slavery; and when Pharaoh made difficulties about letting us go, the Lord slew every first-born in the' + pb(12) + 'land of Egypt, the first-born of both man and beast; that is why I sacrifice to the Lord every first-born male animal, but I redeem all my first-born sons. This shall serve as a sign on your hand, and as frontlets between your eyes; for the Lord brought you out of Egypt by a strong hand.”'))
