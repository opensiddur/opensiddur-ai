"""Birnbaum's English for the Torah blessings and Birkhoth ha-Shaḥar, pages 14 to 20.

Same URNs as the Hebrew, which is what aligns them.

**One blessing here is not in any transcription of this page.** Printed 16 ends with the
blessing beginning *who hast not made me…*, and both the en.wikisource text and the
Internet Archive OCR stop one blessing earlier. It was read off the page image instead --
see `readings/english_14_20.md`. Two derived witnesses agreeing with each other and with
neither the page nor each other's gaps is exactly why the page is the evidence here.

**The English runs two passages together where the Hebrew parts them.** Printed 20 sets the
tail of the Yehi Ratzon and the blessing that follows it as one paragraph; printed 19 sets
two. As with Mah Tovu on pages 3 and 4, each side keeps the paragraphing the print gives
it and the parting is named on both, so the columns pair instead of drifting.
