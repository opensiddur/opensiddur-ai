"""Birnbaum's English of Adon Olam and Yigdal, read off printed pages 12 and 14.

Both poems are set in two columns on the Hebrew page and as two stacked lines
per verse line on the English one. Birnbaum's own footnote says ten lines and
thirteen lines, and both sides give exactly that, so the structure is not in
dispute between them and only the setting differs. Each `tei:l` holds a whole
line of verse on both sides; splitting on the Hebrew column or on the English
line break would give twice as many and contradict the book about itself.

This side heads both poems and numbers Yigdal's thirteen lines; the Hebrew page
does neither. The numerals are the print's own and are not part of the text, so
they are `@n` on the line rather than words in it, and only on this side.
