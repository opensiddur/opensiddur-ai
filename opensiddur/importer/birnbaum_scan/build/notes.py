"""Birnbaum's own footnotes, as a standoff apparatus.

The print carries two apparatuses, and they are different things:

*Commentary* sits at the foot of the Hebrew page, keyed by a Hebrew catchword set in
bold, and is set across the opening -- a note begun under a Hebrew page finishes under
the facing English one. Birnbaum describes the keying himself in his introduction: each
note begins with a Hebrew catchword so that a reader can find the explanation he seeks.

*Scripture citations* are numbered, keyed to superscript numerals, and are printed on the
English pages only -- again his own statement, and confirmed by every page read so far.

Both are `tei:note` in one `tei:standOff`, told apart by `@type`. A commentary note
carries the catchword in `tei:label`; a citation carries the printed numeral in `@n`.

Two decisions worth stating, because neither is obvious:

**The apparatus is realised in the English project only.** The commentary is English
prose about Hebrew words, like Birnbaum's introduction, and the same reasoning applies:
English-only material is realised on the English side and the Hebrew reaches it by
resolution rather than by duplication. What is given up is that the commentary begins
physically under the Hebrew page in the print and will not in the rendered PDF.

**A note carries no URN of its own.** `urn:x-opensiddur:notes:` exists for swapping one
edition's apparatus for another's, and there is exactly one Birnbaum apparatus. A note is
not a text: it is addressed by what it annotates, and `@target` says that already.

The printed numeral in `@n` is evidence, not an instruction to the renderer. Birnbaum
restarts at 1 on every page; a PDF repaginates, so the renderer draws its own series.

**A third keying turns up in Rabbi Ishmael's rules.** Under printed 41 the commentary block
carries a centred sub-heading, `ILLUSTRATIONS`, and then a numbered list of worked examples
running 1 to 13 -- one per rule, numbered to match the rules themselves. There is no mark in
the text and no catchword: the *number* is the key. Those are `commentary` with an `@n` and
no `tei:label`.

**A note carries block content.** Printed 41's is the largest in the book: prose, a
sub-heading, a numbered list with lettered sub-items, and a reference to another page. Any
assumption that a note is a paragraph of inline prose is contradicted by that one page.

#: What the apparatus is attached to, per unit. `target` is a `@corresp` URN that the
#: text already carries -- never an `#id`, which `refdb` resolves only inside one file.

#: The notes themselves are in `notes_data`, generated from the English transcription and
#: keyed to URNs by matching against the authored text -- see

#: was one of them; there are eighty-four.
