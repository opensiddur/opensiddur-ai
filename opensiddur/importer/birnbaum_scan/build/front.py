"""The front matter of the 1949 print, leaves 1-25 of the scan.

The words are not here. They are in ``sourcetexts``, under
``sources/birnbaum_siddur/scan_reading/front/``, one well-formed XML fragment per
section, read off the scan and committed there because nothing regenerates a reading.
This module says which leaf holds what, which project realises which section, and how a
leaf the book does not number is designated.

**Designations.** The book prints Roman numerals only from leaf 11 (``IX``) to leaf 25
(``XXIII``). That fixes leaf 3 as ``I``, so leaves 3-10 are designated ``[I]``-``[VIII]``
-- brackets marking a number the book implies rather than prints. Leaves 1 and 2 precede
the Roman sequence entirely and are designated ``[1]`` and ``[2]``.

**Sides.** The book's front matter divides by language exactly as its body does: the
Hebrew title leaf is leaf 2, the English title leaf is leaves 3-4, and the table of
contents is set twice, Hebrew on leaf 6 and English on leaf 7. Each project transcribes
its own leaves, so each project's foliation skips the other's -- the same thing the
Amidah already does with 81/82, 83/84.

**Title pages cannot be transcluded.** ``tei:titlePage`` is in ``model.frontPart``, which
only ``tei:front`` admits; a transcluded section arrives inside a ``tei:div``, which does
not. So the two title leaves are written into each index's ``tei:front`` literally, and
carry ``front:title_page``/``front:copyright`` on themselves so the two sides still
declare the correspondence. Only the prose sections are transcluded.

**Gates.** None of this is prayer, and an edition may leave any of it out: each prose
section is gated on ``opensiddur:paratext/include`` and each title leaf on
``opensiddur:paratext/title-page``, both true unless a volume says otherwise. A title
leaf's page break is lifted out in front of its gate, so the foliation still runs
unbroken when the title page is left out. A prose section's page breaks are its own, and
go with it.
