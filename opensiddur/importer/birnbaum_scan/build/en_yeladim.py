"""Birnbaum's English for Shaḥarith li-Yladim, read off printed page 2.

Emits the SAME URNs as :mod:`he_yeladim`, which is what aligns the two columns.

Read off the scan, as page 1 was, and afterwards checked against the proofread
en.wikisource transcription of the same leaf. 185 words, one difference, and the scan
settled it for the print: Birnbaum closes "falsehood." with a full stop where the
transcription has a comma. The facing Hebrew agrees — it closes מִרְמָה with a full stop
too, where the longer page-95 meditation has a comma because the sentence runs on there.
The transcription had punctuated the abridged text as though it were the long one.

The paragraph under "When dressed:" is continuous prose on this side too, with no visual
break between the nine texts it holds -- so it is segmented exactly as the Hebrew is, at
``tei:seg``, with matching URNs. There is nothing in either column's layout to align on;
the URNs are the whole mechanism. A ``@corresp`` repeated inside one document breaks that
join silently, so every slug here appears exactly once.

One thing the reading records that the encoding deliberately does not: this page sets its
rubrics in italic, and the facing Hebrew page sets the same rubrics in roman. Inside the
third rubric that inverts -- "arba kanfoth" is italic against roman on the Hebrew page and
indistinguishable inside the italic rubric here. Both sides mark the term as foreign and
leave the rest to the typography.

    that a division holds content or subdivisions but never both is real, but it bites
    where a division would hold words alongside a conditional, and every such division
