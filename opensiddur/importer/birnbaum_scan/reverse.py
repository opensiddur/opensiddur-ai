"""Check the authored text against the reading, page by page and word for word.

`compare` runs in one direction only: it asks how far the Wikisource transcription stands
from the reading. It says nothing about whether the TEI actually carries what the reading
records. Those are different questions, and the second one has been wrong twice:

- Printed page 21 lost its last line from the reading and from the transcription at once,
  so `compare` reported nothing and every downstream check stayed green.
- The first draft of `he_akedah` had six words typed from memory rather than lifted from
  the reading -- a `,` for a `.`, a dropped clause of eight words, an added `בְּתוֹרָתֶֽךָ`.
  Nothing in the schema, the registry or the reference database can see any of that.

So this asks the other question: **for each printed page, do the words the generator emits
on that page equal the words the reading records for it?** It is a diff, not a tally, and
a single wrong vowel fails it.

Why page by page rather than end to end: a first attempt concatenated the authored files in
*filename* order and reported 380 words missing that were in fact present, in a different
place. Ordering by printed page is what makes the answer mean anything -- and it also
localises a failure to the page whose image can settle it.

Transclusion is the one thing that has to be declared. A unit that transcludes a text
realised by another unit emits nothing for it, so those words are on the page in the print
and absent from this unit's files. :data:`TRANSCLUDED` names them, which is also a standing
record of what the consolidation still owes.
