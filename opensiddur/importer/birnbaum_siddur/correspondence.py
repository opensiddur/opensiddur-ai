"""Tie the Birnbaum siddur's three sources together, page by page.

One printing, one scan, three transcriptions of it, none of them complete:

* ``text/`` — Hebrew Wikisource. Has the Hebrew, renders Birnbaum's English rubrics
  into Hebrew of its own, and leaves the facing English pages as bare
  ``{{iwpage|en}}`` stubs.
* ``en/`` — English Wikisource, the same scan in the same ``Page:`` namespace. Human
  transcription, and so the best text there is, but only 284 of 815 pages exist and
  under half of those have been proofread.
* ``ia/ocr/`` — the Internet Archive's OCR of the same scan. Complete, machine-read,
  and hopeless at Hebrew.

This module writes ``pages.json``, which says for every one of the 815 leaves what it
is and where its text should come from. It is the artifact every later stage reads,
and it is *derived*: regenerate it, never edit it by hand.

Two things it works out rather than assumes.

**Which side of the opening a page is.** From the markers, never from parity. Odd
scan pages are usually English and even usually Hebrew, but ten pages break that, and
they break it in two contiguous runs — Hoshanot and one other section print Hebrew
with no facing English at all. A parity rule would mis-pair every page after each run.

**What the printed page number is.** The Hebrew transcription states it in a running
header, which is a human reading the page and so the best evidence available — except
where it is wrong. See :func:`resolve_printed_pages`.
