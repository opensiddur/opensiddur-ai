"""Haftarot, festival readings and the modern triennial cycle, read from the hebcal data.

MAM records no haftarot and no festival readings at all, so these come from hebcal. Each is
modelled as a *passage*: an ordered list of spans, because a haftarah is frequently
discontinuous and occasionally moves backwards through its book — Mishpatim reads Jeremiah
34:8-22 and then 33:25-26 — and because two of them bridge books.
