"""Turn overlapping reading divisions into a linear sequence of milestones and transclusions.

The humash contributes structure over text it does not hold: every word is transcluded from
the Tanakh projects by URN. The problem this module solves is that the divisions overlap, in
two different ways, which need two different answers.

**Between unit-spaces.** The maftir begins inside the seventh aliyah, the weekday aliyot
subdivide the Shabbat ones, and the triennial breaks cut across the annual ones. Here the text
is read once and marked several ways, so the spans are cut at the *union* of all their
boundaries and the text emitted once, with every milestone that falls at a point placed
before the segment starting there. A printed humash marks maftir in the margin of the seventh
aliyah; it does not print those verses twice.

**Within one unit-space.** On weekday Rosh Hodesh, Numbers 28:1-15 divides kohen 28:1-3, levi
28:3-5, yisrael 28:6-10, revi'i 28:11-15 — 28:3 belongs to both kohen and levi and really is
read twice. Cutting at the union cannot express that, so a unit-space whose own spans overlap
is emitted span by span and the shared verses are transcluded twice.
