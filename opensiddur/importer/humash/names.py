"""The parshah names the humash needs beyond the shared table.

The 54 weekly names, and lookups by Hebrew or hebcal name, live in
:mod:`opensiddur.importer.util.parshiyot` and are re-exported here. What is local to the
humash is the *pairs*: the weeks on which two parshiyot are read together. The shared table
knows a pair's hebcal name because hebcal names one, but the humash also needs the Hebrew
form to match MAM, and needs to know which two parshiyot each pair joins so that a combined
week's aliyot can be scoped to the pair rather than to either member.
