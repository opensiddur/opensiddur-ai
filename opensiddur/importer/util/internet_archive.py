"""Reading an Internet Archive item: its metadata, its files, and its OCR.

The Archive is the second source of scanned books this project reads, after
Wikisource, and the two overlap more than they look like they should: a Commons scan
indexed by a Wikisource ``Index:`` page is frequently the very same scan the Archive
holds, digitised once and copied. When that is so — compare the file names, and the
sha1 in :func:`fetch_metadata` — the Archive's OCR can be aligned to the Wikisource
transcription leaf by leaf for nothing, and each fills the other's gaps.

This module speaks to archive.org and parses its derivative formats. It knows nothing
about any particular book or about where files belong on disk; that is the importer's
job. It deliberately reuses the HTTP etiquette already written for Wikisource rather
than growing a second, subtly different implementation of pacing and backoff — see
:ref:`the policy note <ia-bot-policy>` in :func:`build_session`.

The one piece of arithmetic worth stating once, because getting it wrong is silent:
the Archive numbers *leaves* from zero, while a ``ProofreadPage`` wiki numbers *pages*
from one. Nothing here converts between them — an importer that pairs the two sources
owns that offset and should keep it in exactly one place.
