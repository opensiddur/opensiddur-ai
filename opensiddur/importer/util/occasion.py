"""Occasion conditions for a book's running order.

A section said only on some days -- the weekday services, the Sabbath services, Hallel, the
festival services -- is conditioned where its running order transcludes it: the outermost point
at which the condition can be stated, so that one condition governs the whole section. Such a
condition is a direction to the processor, not to the reader, so it carries no instruction and
is not ``type="marked"``: an edition that cannot decide it prints the section with nothing around
it (``schema/JLPTEI-3.md``, *Conditions on a running order*).

Conditions are written here as data -- :class:`Feature` literals combined with :func:`all_of`,
:func:`any_of` and :func:`none_of` -- so that the same data renders the markup and says which
features a condition fixes to one value. Those are declared inside the conditional, so that
the section's own conditions on them are decided even where the date is not.
