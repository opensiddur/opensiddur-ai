"""Split MAM's verses into canonical verses.

MAM numbers by ta'am tachton, which in the Decalogue merges the four short commandments
into one verse and reads אנכי together with לא יהיה לך. The canonical URN space numbers the
union of the two cantillations' boundaries, so several canonical verses can fall inside one
MAM verse, and a project that emitted one milestone per MAM verse would give those canonical
verses no URN of their own -- or, as the importer previously did, give them all the *same*
URN, which the reference database and the parallel compiler both silently collapse.

MAM ships both cantillation strands (``{{מ:כפול|כפול=…|א=…|ב=…}}``), so the interior
boundaries are derivable from MAM's own source: wherever the ta'am elyon strand ends a verse
but MAM's own does not, a canonical verse ends. Where a merge is not cantillation-driven --
Numbers 26:1, which carries canonical 25:19 ahead of it -- the boundary is a parashah break
in the middle of the verse instead.

How many canonical verses a MAM verse covers is not inferred from the source; it comes from
:mod:`opensiddur.common.versification`, and the boundaries found here must agree with it.
A mismatch means the source and the table disagree about the text, which is an error worth
stopping for rather than papering over.
