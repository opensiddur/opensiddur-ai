"""Sub-verse milestones: the accentual half-verse, and named parts of a verse.

A URN reaches no further than a whole verse unless something inside the verse carries one.
Two milestone units divide a verse, and both hang a URN one component below the verse's:

``half-verse``
    The accentual division, at the etnachta. `a` runs from the start of the verse to the
    accent, `b` from there to the end. Derived from the text itself, so it can be placed
    everywhere without anyone declaring anything.

``verse-part``
    A break the accents do not make — the Thirteen Attributes open at the second יהוה of
    Exodus 34:6, three words before its etnachta, and close one word past the etnachta of
    34:7. These cannot be derived, so they are declared in `VERSE_PARTS` and named by their
    transliterated incipit, the same way JLPTEI-3.md already names divisions of a poem.

The two divisions cut at different points and are separate unit-spaces: neither ends the
other's scope (see `UNIT_CONTAINED_BY` in opensiddur/exporter/refdb.py).

Both are inserted by a pass over converted TEI rather than by each importer's XSLT, because
Miqra al pi ha-Masorah and the WLC emit the same shape by the time they are TEI — running
text with inline elements in it — while their sources do not resemble each other at all.
