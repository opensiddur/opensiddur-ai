"""Canonical verse numbering for the ``urn:x-opensiddur:text:bible:`` URN space.

A verse URN is the only join key between projects: the parallel compiler pairs two
documents' text by exact ``@corresp`` equality, and the reference database resolves
transclusion ranges by it. That only works if ``exodus/20/13`` denotes the same stretch of
text in every project, which is not true of the editions' own numbering.

**The canonical division.** A canonical verse boundary is any point that is a verse boundary
under *either* ta'am elyon or ta'am tachton. In the Decalogue the two cantillations divide
differently -- ta'am tachton merges the four short commandments into one verse and splits
אנכי from לא יהיה לך, ta'am elyon does the reverse -- so their union is finer than either.
That union is what the Leningrad Codex numbers, giving Exodus 20 = 26 verses and
Deuteronomy 5 = 33. Every edition's own division is a coarsening of it, so an edition verse
is always a whole number of consecutive canonical verses.

Outside the Decalogue the editions still disagree in a handful of places, for reasons that
have nothing to do with cantillation. Those are recorded in :data:`DIVERGENCES` below.

**What this module is not.** It does not map the Decalogue. MAM ships both cantillation
strands, so its importer derives the canonical boundaries from its own source rather than
from a table here (see ``importer/miqra_al_pi_hamasorah``); a table would be a second,
divergent statement of the same fact. The Decalogue entries here exist only so that
references *stated* in an edition's numbering -- hebcal aliyah boundaries, a cross-reference
in a translation -- can be resolved to canonical.
