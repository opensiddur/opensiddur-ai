""" Build the electronic book (HTML) and the printed one (PDF) for every settings file in a
settings directory.

The settings directory (opensiddur-projects/settings/) has one subdirectory per book, named for
the project it is built from, holding that book's settings files:
settings/chumash-opensiddur-he/annual.yaml, settings/chumash-opensiddur-he/triennial.yaml. Each
names the root file it formats in its `book:` key and says how it differs from its siblings in
`description:`. Each month, opensiddur-projects is tagged with a date (vYYYYMMDD) and every book
is built and attached to that release (.github/workflows/release-projects.yml), named
<book>-<settings>[-<tag>].pdf and .html.

The books are built with the latest opensiddur-processor release. Each settings file declares in
`requires_processor:` the processor versions that build it; `--list`, which is what the release
builds, leaves out a book whose requirement the processor running it does not meet. The
requirement is read before the rest of the file is validated, because a book waiting for a newer
release usually uses a key an older processor does not know.

Each book is built in the formats its settings list in `formats:`, both unless it says
otherwise. `--format pdf` or `--format html` builds only that one, for the books that list it;
a book that does not is skipped, not failed. The electronic book is one self-contained
<book>-<settings>[-<tag>].html (opensiddur/exporter/html/html.py). It is compiled separately,
with `--destination electronic`, which leaves the settings a reader supplies for the reader's
device to decide. `--formats` prints the formats one book lists, for the release workflow.

`--check` validates without building: the YAML parses and matches the settings schema, it
declares `requires_processor:` and this processor meets it, the project and file the book names
exist, and every font chain the book will be typeset with has
an installed font. Pull requests to opensiddur-projects run it.

A book that fails is reported and skipped; the others are still built. The exit status is
nonzero if any book failed, so a partial set of books is never mistaken for a full one.

The reference database must already be built (python -m opensiddur.exporter.refdb):
the compiler reads it from its default location.
