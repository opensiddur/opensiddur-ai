    — dispatching by value kind:

    - ``urn:x-opensiddur:...`` — resolved via refdb (``@corresp``-based range addressing).
      Skipped entirely when ``check_urns`` is false: unlike the file/fragment check below,
      this one is only meaningful once every project a URN might resolve into has been
      indexed into refdb, which is a separate, explicit step
      (``python -m opensiddur.exporter.refdb``) — not something one project's conversion can
      itself guarantee.
    - ``/{project}/{file}#{fragment}`` — resolved by looking up that ``xml:id`` directly in
      the named file (see ``opensiddur.exporter.xml_id_ref``). Self-contained: no refdb or
      cross-project state required, so this check always runs.
    - ``http://``/``https://`` and a same-file ``#id`` (e.g. ``j:endConditional/@target``, a
      standoff note's anchor) are out of scope.

    When both ``@target`` and ``@targetEnd`` are URNs, they're treated as a range: ``@targetEnd``
    must resolve within the project ``@target`` did (this is how ``j:transclude`` uses the pair,
