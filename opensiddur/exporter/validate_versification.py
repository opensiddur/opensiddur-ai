"""Check that the Tanakh projects agree about what each verse URN denotes.

A verse URN is the only join key between projects: the parallel compiler pairs text by exact
``@corresp`` equality and the reference database resolves transclusion ranges by it. Nothing
in the schema enforces that two projects mean the same thing by ``exodus/20/13``, and when
they disagree nothing fails -- the compiler simply pairs the wrong verses and a range stops
early. This validator is what notices.

Two checks:

* **Duplicates.** A URN naming two places within one project. The reference database keeps
  one of them and every other segment becomes unreachable.
* **Coverage.** The verse URNs each project exposes for a chapter they share. A project that
  is missing verses another has will silently drop text from a parallel compile or a range.

Verses genuinely absent from a witness are not errors, and are listed in
:data:`KNOWN_ABSENCES`. Chapters where a project's verse *count* is still under
investigation are listed in :data:`UNRESOLVED_CHAPTERS`, so they are reported separately
from new regressions rather than drowning them out.
