"""Prepare a compiled document's undecided conditions for an electronic book.

A scope the compiler could not decide reaches the compiled document as a pair of sibling
markers, `j:conditional` ... `j:endConditional`, around whatever it governs -- a phrase, a
paragraph, a run of sections. On the page the reader's device shows or hides what a scope
governs, which the HTML can only do element by element. Scopes may also cross, so they cannot
simply become wrapping elements.

So instead, every element and every run of text is labelled with each scope that governs all
of it, and the device hides whatever carries the label of a scope that does not hold. This
pass computes the labels on the compiled tree, as `p:scopes` attributes and `p:span` wrappers
around text, for html.xslt to turn into classes:

- an element is governed by a scope that is open at its start and still open at its end;
- a run of text, by every scope open where it stands;
- each is labelled only with the scopes its parent is not already labelled with.

A parallel column is a stream of its own. A scope opened in the primary column governs that
column through the rows that follow, and not the column beside it; a scope opened outside the
columns governs both.

The pass also numbers the scopes (`p:cid`, on both markers) and collects their conditions, for
the book's JSON.
