"""Compiled JLPTEI to an electronic book: one self-contained HTML file.

The book is a document and a program at once. Its text is html.xslt's rendering of the compiled
file; its program resolves the passages the compile left undecided, on the reader's device,
against the reader's own settings and the device's clock (assets/calendar.js,
assets/condition.js, assets/reader.js). Styles, scripts and
data are all inline, so the one file is the whole book: it opens from a disk, a USB stick or
an email, offline, and needs nothing else.

Read without scripts, the page is the printed book: <style id="os-cond-default"> holds the
rules a compile of the same settings file would have applied, computed here.

Compile with `--destination electronic` first, so that the settings a reader supplies are left
for the reader:

    python -m opensiddur.exporter.compiler -s SETTINGS --destination electronic -o book.xml
    python -m opensiddur.exporter.html.html book.xml book.html -s SETTINGS
