    A range is written with '-' in a path component. The part before the dash closes the
    start URN; what follows names the end. There are two ways to name the end:

    **Relative** — the end replaces that many trailing components of the start, which leaves
    it at the same depth::

        genesis/1/1-2      → genesis/1/1  … genesis/1/2
        genesis/1/1-2/3    → genesis/1/1  … genesis/2/3
        nahum/2/2/b-2/3/a  → nahum/2/2/b  … nahum/2/3/a

    **Absolute** — an end that begins with '/' replaces the whole path below the component
    carrying the namespace and the work, so the two ends need not be at the same depth::

        nahum/2/2/b-/2/5   → nahum/2/2/b  … nahum/2/5
        genesis/1/1-/3     → genesis/1/1  … genesis/3

    Write the absolute form whenever the ends are at different depths: a sub-verse start
    with a whole-verse end has no relative spelling, since a relative end always lands at
    the start's own depth. This is also why a range cannot cross works — the absolute form
    keeps the start's namespace-and-work component, and the relative form never touches it.

    A project need not carry every division another project does: a translation has no

    verse that contains it or the translation drops out of the page altogether. Reading a
    whole verse where half was asked for is the behaviour that was there before sub-verse
    URNs existed; what is new is that the caller knows it happened and can say so.

    Only a point below a Bible verse is coarsened. A whole verse is not widened to its
    chapter, and the parent of any other URN is a different text, not a coarser division of
    the same one: falling back from a part of the Amidah to the whole Amidah would print the
    wrong thing.

    In a range each end is coarsened by itself, and only if it is below the verse and does
    not resolve (``resolves`` says which do; without it, every end below the verse is taken
    not to). An end that is already a verse stays where it is, so ``2:2b-2:5`` falls back to
    ``2:2-2:5`` rather than to the rest of chapter 2. The result is stated absolutely, since
