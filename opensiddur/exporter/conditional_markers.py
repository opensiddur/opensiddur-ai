"""Check that the conditional scopes a compile leaves undecided still come in pairs.

A `j:conditional` the compiler could not decide is copied into its output with the
`j:endConditional` that closes it, and every downstream stage finds the scope by pairing the
two: `xml:id` on the opener, `@target="#id"` on the closer. Reledmac brackets the text between
them; an electronic book shows or hides it. A pair that lost one end governs nothing a stage
can find -- an opener with no closer prints a bracket that never shuts -- so the pairing is
worth checking on its own rather than through how each stage happens to cope.

Scopes may cross; that is not a problem. What is:

- an opener with no closer, or a closer with no opener;
- a closer that comes before its opener;
- two openers with the same id;
- a pair whose ends lie in different parallel columns, or one in a column and one in the
  main flow, since each column is typeset as a stream of its own.
